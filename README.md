## The Problem

Training machine learning models is inherently non-deterministic:
- Floating-point operations vary across platforms
- Parallel reductions produce different results each run
- Stochastic gradient descent introduces randomness
- Data shuffling depends on random number generators

For safety-critical systems, you cannot certify what you cannot reproduce.

## The Solution

`certifiable-training` defines training as a **deterministic state evolution**:

### 1. Fixed-Point Arithmetic
Q16.16 weights, Q8.24 gradients, Q32.32 accumulators. Same math, same result, every platform.

### 2. Deterministic Reduction
Fixed tree topology with Neumaier compensated summation. Parallel execution, deterministic result.

### 3. Reproducible "Randomness"
Counter-based PRNG: `PRNG(seed, op_id, step) → deterministic bits`. Same seed = same sequence.

### 4. Merkle Audit Trail
Every training step cryptographically committed. Any step verifiable in O(1) time.

**Result:** `θ_T = T^(T)(θ_0, D, seed)` — Training is a pure function.

## Status

**All core modules complete — 10/10 test suites passing.**

## Quick Start

### Build

All project tasks are available as Makefile targets, and GitHub Actions CI uses
these to ensure that they are not stale. Documentation of the commands are
available via `make help`.

When building the project for the first time, run `make deps`.

To building everything (i.e. config, build, test), run `make`. Otherwise, use
individual Makefile targets as desired.

```bash
$ make help
Makefile Usage:
  make <target>

Dependencies
  deps             Install project dependencies

Development
  config           Configure the build
  build            Build the project

Testing
  test             Run tests

Project Management
  install          Install the project
  release          Build release artifacts

Maintenance
  clean            Remove all build artifacts

Documentation
  help             Display this help
```

### Expected Output

```
100% tests passed, 0 tests failed out of 10
Total Test time (real) = 0.04 sec
```

### Basic Training Step

```c
#include "ct_types.h"
#include "dvm.h"
#include "forward.h"
#include "backward.h"
#include "optimizer.h"
#include "merkle.h"
#include "permutation.h"

// All buffers pre-allocated (no malloc)
fixed_t weights[784 * 128];
grad_t gradients[784 * 128];
ct_fault_flags_t faults = {0};

// Initialize Merkle chain
ct_merkle_ctx_t merkle;
ct_merkle_init(&merkle, &weights_tensor, config, config_size, seed);

// Get batch via deterministic permutation
ct_batch_ctx_t batch;
ct_batch_init(&batch, seed, epoch, dataset_size, batch_size);
ct_batch_get_indices(&batch, step, indices, &faults);

// Forward pass
ct_forward_linear(&layer, input, output, &faults);
ct_forward_relu(output, activated, size, &faults);

// Backward pass
ct_backward_relu(grad_out, activated, grad_in, size, &faults);
ct_backward_linear(&layer, grad_in, &faults);

// Optimizer step
ct_sgd_step(&sgd, weights, gradients, size, &faults);

// Commit to Merkle chain
ct_merkle_step(&merkle, &weights_tensor, indices, batch_size, &step_record, &faults);

if (ct_has_fault(&faults)) {
    // Chain invalidated - do not proceed
}
```

## Architecture

### Deterministic Virtual Machine (DVM)

All arithmetic operations use widening and saturation:

```c
// CORRECT: Explicit widening
int64_t wide = (int64_t)a + (int64_t)b;
return dvm_clamp32(wide, &faults);

// FORBIDDEN: Raw overflow
return a + b;  // Undefined behavior
```

### Fixed-Point Formats

| Format | Use Case | Range | Precision |
|--------|----------|-------|-----------|
| Q16.16 | Weights, activations | ±32768 | 1.5×10⁻⁵ |
| Q8.24 | Gradients | ±128 | 5.9×10⁻⁸ |
| Q32.32 | Accumulators | ±2³¹ | 2.3×10⁻¹⁰ |

### Fault Model

Every operation signals faults without silent failure:

```c
typedef struct {
    uint32_t overflow    : 1;  // Saturated high
    uint32_t underflow   : 1;  // Saturated low
    uint32_t div_zero    : 1;  // Division by zero
    uint32_t domain      : 1;  // Invalid input
    uint32_t precision   : 1;  // Precision loss detected
} ct_fault_flags_t;
```

### Merkle Audit Trail

Every training step produces a cryptographic commitment:

```
h_t = SHA256(h_{t-1} || H(θ_t) || H(B_t) || t)
```

Any step can be independently verified. If faults occur, the chain is invalidated.

### Data Permutation

Cycle-Walking Feistel provides true bijection for any dataset size N:

```
π: [0, N-1] → [0, N-1]  (one-to-one and onto)
```

Same seed + epoch = same shuffle, every time, every platform.

## Why This Matters

### Medical Devices
IEC 62304 Class C requires traceable, reproducible software. Non-deterministic training cannot be validated.

### Autonomous Vehicles
ISO 26262 ASIL-D demands provable behavior. Training must be auditable.

### Aerospace
DO-178C Level A requires complete requirements traceability. "We trained it and it works" is not certifiable.

This is the first ML training system designed from the ground up for safety-critical certification.

## Compliance Support

This implementation is designed to support certification under:
- **DO-178C** (Aerospace software)
- **IEC 62304** (Medical device software)
- **ISO 26262** (Automotive functional safety)
